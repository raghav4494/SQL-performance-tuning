# SQL-performance-tuning
The aim of our project is to reduce execution time of some queries which plays around huge volumes of data. We want to show considerable reduction in query running time when compared with old and normal projection.

This is a team project done as a part of the course "Database sytsems". 

# To execute the program
1. Open the Oracle SQL developer
2. To create tables, run the commands starting with create in the sql file.
3. To insert the data, execute the commands beginning with insert.
4. To see the query output, execute the statements starting with select.
5. To see the performance of all the queries that are tried, append the command "set autotrace on" and execute the select statement together.
6. To view the result, switch to the script output tab from query result tab.
7. To compare the performance of two queries, run the first query and click the red pin on the left side of the script output window. 
8. Then execute the second query. It will create it's script output in a new tab.
